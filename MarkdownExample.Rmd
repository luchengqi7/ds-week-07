## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



## Including my parts
```{r newPart, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
drt_trips <- read_delim("pave188b.drt_trips.csv.gz", 
                        delim = ";", 
                        locale = locale(decimal_mark = "."))

all_trips <- read_delim("pave188b.output_trips.csv.gz", 
                        delim = ";", 
                        locale = locale(decimal_mark = "."),
                        col_types = cols(
                          person=col_character()
                        ))
    

ggplot(data = drt_trips, mapping = aes(x=fromX, y=fromY))+
  geom_point(size=0.2, alpha=0.1, color="blue")+
  coord_quickmap()

ggplot(data = drt_trips, mapping = aes(x=fromX, y=fromY))+
  geom_hex()


ggplot(all_trips)+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=dep_time, fill=main_mode), binwidth = 900)

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
